# Grafbat-Plane-Normalizer
Normalizes the point and text plane values to match the corresponding lines
## What it does

The plane normalizer's job is to take in a GRAFBAT file created by GEOgraf and normalize the 
text's and point's planes to equal the plane of the corresponding line. 
The program also takes in a file called prioConfiguration.txt placed  next to the exe or the script.
This configuration file contains a prioritization of Line Id's in descending order.
The purpose of this configuration is to define which line's plane a point's plane is normalized to (Because a point can be part of multiple lines).

## How to use
TBD
